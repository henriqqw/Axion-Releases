## Overview

Axion turns a local folder of `.md` files into a polished, interactive Notion-like workspace. This repository serves as the official distribution point for pre-compiled binaries. Axion features zero databases, zero subscriptions, and absolute file-system ownership.

### The Unified Interface
Axion blends native file types into a single high-performance experience:
- **Pages** (`.md`): Rich-text WYSIWYG documents powered by Tiptap v3.
- **Workspaces** (`.md`): Dynamic Datagrids aggregating folder metadata.
- **Canvases** (`.canvas`): Infinite whiteboards powered by TLDRAW.
